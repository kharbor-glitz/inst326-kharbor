This week I used AI to be able to decide on what I wanted to do for my cumulative group project. 
I knew the category but I didnt know what dataset I wanted to make my program based on so i asked ChatGPT for some ideas.
Chat gave me several Ideas such as sports stats and restauraunt sales.
However I wanted a meaningful dataset to look at.
I was able to settle on public health statistics in the end though.

Week 3 Entry
This week I used AI to help me generate my Week 4 NFL parlay moneyline picks. 
I asked ChatGPT to generate its own predictions for all of the 16 games and include the reason for each choice. 
I used AI to get strategic guidance and differing perspectives on the games, but I personally made the final selections on my parlay. 
I did not use AI to place bets automatically.

I also experimented with pitting upset picks against favorites using AI. 
This made me more methodical in which teams would over- or under-perform based on injury, home-field disparity, and recent momentum.
At the end of the week, I compared ChatGPT's picks to mine and to public betting lines and identified where the widest disparities were. 
The logic of the AI would occasionally be fully in agreement with gaming odds,
but occasionally it reported surprise pairings that made me reconsider my initial selections. 
I found that different analytic "biases" in models can produce very divergent predictions, 
just as different sports commentators can spin the same facts differently.

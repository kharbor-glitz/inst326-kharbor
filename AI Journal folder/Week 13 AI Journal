The other day, I used AI to help me understand a technical topic from one of my Information Science classes that I was confused about.
I asked ChatGPT to explain the idea in simpler terms and give examples that related to real-world situations.
I made use of AI to support my learning, but I still reviewed my notes and tried to connect the explanation back to what we covered in class.
I did not use AI to complete homework or assignments.
I also tried asking the same question in a few different ways until it finally clicked.
By the end, I felt a lot more confident in my understanding and less stressed about the material

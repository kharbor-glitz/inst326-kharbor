Research & Source Summarization
This week I used AI to help me summarize research articles for my history project.
I asked ChatGPT to highlight the main arguments, key dates, and important figures from several sources.
I used AI to get an overview and better organize my notes, but I personally wrote all summaries and citations.
I did not use AI to write the research paper for me.
I also experimented with asking AI to compare perspectives across articles, which helped me identify patterns and contradictions I hadn’t noticed.
By the end of the week, my notes were clearer, and I felt more prepared for writing the project.

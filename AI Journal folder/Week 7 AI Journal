Research & Source Summarization
This week, I used AI to help me summarize research articles for my history project.
I asked ChatGPT to highlight the main arguments, key dates, and important figures from the sources provided.
AI gave me an overview and allowed me to better organize my notes, but I wrote all summaries and citations myself.
I did not use AI to write the research paper for me.
I also tried asking AI to compare perspectives across articles, which helped me find patterns and contradictions that I had not seen.
The notes were more understandable by the end of the week, and then I felt prepared for the writing of the project.

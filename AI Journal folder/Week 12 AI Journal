The other day, I used AI to help me think through a personal decision I was unsure about.
I asked ChatGPT to help me list out different options and talk through the possible pros and cons of each one.
I made use of AI to organize my thoughts and slow down my decision-making process, but I personally made the final choice.
I did not rely on AI to decide for me.
I also tried asking follow-up questions to think about long-term outcomes instead of just short-term convenience.
By the end, I felt more confident in my decision because I had taken the time to think it through more carefully.

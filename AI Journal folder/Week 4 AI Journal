Week 4 Entry
I used AI this week to help me edit the second draft of my English Literature essay.
I asked ChatGPT to identify muddled sentences, clarify my thesis statement, and suggest improved transitions between the paragraphs.
I used AI to give writing suggestions and stylistic suggestions, but I wrote all the sections myself.
I did not use AI to write my essay from scratch or replace my own analysis.

I also attempted to ask AI to generate some thesis ideas, which caused me to think about what argument was the most vital and controversial.
This caused me to be more purposeful with my claims and the evidence I used in favor of them.
Ultimately, I read over my first draft compared to the revised one and noticed neater structure and more effective arguments.

Week 5 Entry
This week, I utilized AI to help me schedule my study plan for all the classes.
I asked ChatGPT to create a weekly study plan based on my class timings, assignment due dates, and exam dates.
I utilized AI to get strategic guidance on how to mix homework, revision sessions, and breaks, but I myself created the exact sequence and duration of blocks of studies.
I did not use AI to auto-submit or pre-schedule my work.

I also attempted using AI to recommend "focus techniques" and study plans for challenging subjects, which helped me address more challenging topics ahead of the week.
This assisted my study routine in becoming more focused and efficient, and by the end of the week I was completing assignments more consistently and feeling less panic in the last minute.

The other day, I used AI to help brainstorm ideas for campfire stories.
I asked ChatGPT to provide different scenarios for spooky, funny, and adventurous stories that could be appealing in a group environment.
I made use of AI to generate inspiration and explore creative directions, but I personally wrote and told the final stories myself.
I have not used AI to either deliver the stories or record them.
I also tried asking AI to combine several ideas into one story, which helped me to create more dynamic and unexpected plot twists.
By the end, the stories were more imaginative, and I felt confident in capturing an audience with unique twists and engaging characters.

Recently, I utilized AI technology to discover more information about various job opportunities that relate to Information Science.
I asked ChatGPT about the kinds of tasks involved on a typical day for workers in the areas of cybersecurity, data analysis, and information systems.
I utilized AI in attempting to find out the types of things I might be interested in, or at least can see a connection with AI, whereas I personally reflected on what type of subject I might find most interesting.
I have not used AI in applying for job positions or in making any job-related decisions on my behalf.
I also asked the AI if it knew what skills employers are commonly searching for in such positions.

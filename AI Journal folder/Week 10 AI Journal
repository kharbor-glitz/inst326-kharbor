The other day, I used AI to learn more about different career paths connected to Information Science.
I asked ChatGPT to explain what jobs in cybersecurity, data analysis, and information systems actually look like on a day-to-day basis.
I made use of AI to explore my options and get a better sense of what I might be interested in, but I personally reflected on what felt like the best fit for me.
I did not use AI to apply for jobs or make career decisions on my behalf.
I also tried asking AI what kinds of skills employers usually look for in these roles.
By the end, I felt more confident about the direction I want to work toward and what I should focus on learning while I’m still in school.
